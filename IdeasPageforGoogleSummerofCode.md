# Introduction #

Google Summer of Code Students, we need you! Really Simple History is currently a one-developer organization. RSH code steward Brian Dillard would love to mentor you as you plunge into the world of Ajax history and bookmarking. Are you a JavaScript ninja-in-training looking to make your mark in the Ajax world? Really Simple History is the place for you.

Please note that all student project ideas require a developer with a passion for browser hacking and a good grasp of JavaScript and the modern Ajax-library environment.

# Student Project Ideas #

## Idea 1 ##

Create a pluggable architecture for Really Simple History to interface with other, general-purpose Ajax libraries. A good percentage of the code in RSH is dedicated to making it library-agnostic. Rather than replicating low-level JavaScript interoperability itself, RSH could delegate low-level functionality to a series of adapter plug-ins that map these low-level functions to Prototype, jQuery, MooTools or other popular libraries.

## Idea 2 ##

Help build toward RSH 1.0 by coding its support for IE8 and Firefox 3. Ajax history libraries have to keep up with the latest browsers. You could be the lucky developer to dig through the beta releases of the latest browsers and figure out how to ensure that RSH works in these untested environments.

## Idea 3 ##

Build a version of RSH for Safari Mobile. Help iPhone developers achieve Ajax bookmarking capabilities.
