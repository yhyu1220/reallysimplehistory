# Stable Production Version #

## 0.6 ##

The final build of version 0.6 was released 12.03.2007. The only change from 0.6 RC1 is the inclusion of more complete release notes and a minified version of the library.

# Forthcoming Versions #

## 0.8 ##

RSH 0.8 will begin be released as a beta in late December 2007. It will offer a number of enhancements, including the following:

  * Automatic escaping and unescaping of history points; in 0.6, if you want a history key with spaces or special characters, you have to escape and unescape it in your application code.
  * Support for automatic title changes with each new history point; you'll be able to pass a title in with each call to dhtmlHistory.add and see it updated in the browser title bar and history stack.
  * A configurable location for blank.html, the html file that enables the library to work in Internet Explorer.
  * A totally rewired internal structure using Crockford's module pattern. Private members will be truly private, and the number of global variables will be reduced from 2 to 1.
  * An exhaustive tutorial on how to use RSH for a number of different application types.


## 1.0 ##

RSH 1.0 will be released in late Q1 2008. It will include JsUnit and Selenium test coverage.
